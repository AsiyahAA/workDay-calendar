# workDay-calendar
## Description
### Project purpose was to create a work-day calander that would be able to stores events in the local storage that should reappear with the page reloading. Each timeblock section should have a highlighted color that corresponds to a time. If the time was the current hour, the timeblock would appear pink (present), if there was a time before the current hour, timebloack would appear gray (past), and if the time was after the current hour, timebloack would appear green (future). The save button would save the event into the local storage until storage is cleared by user. 
### User should be able to see a a clear header and a date displayed on the header with the current date. User should see time blocks from 9am-5pm (the usual work hours) that are colored depending on the time of day if the hour is in the present, past or future. User should be able to type an event into the timeblock and click the save button which would save the data into the local storage and the data would appear in the same timeblock each time the page reloads until user clears local storage.  
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to make a code from scratch. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update website. Bootstrap was used to copy a grid system onto the HTML file to make the calander table format, as well as a jumbotron for the header. J-query was also used for some formatting and google fonts was used to set a font choice for the text.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make a new HTML file titled index.html, a new CSS folder titled style.css, and a new JavaScript folder called script.js and make sure that both the CSS and JavaScript folders are linked on the HTML file. The CSS stylesheet should be linked in the "head" section/tag while the JavaScript sheet should be linked on the bottom of the bag in the "body" section/tag. Start on adding to the starter code given in HTML code and make sure to add on the classes given to you in the CSS file starter code. Once that is completed, start on your JavaScript file and view all changes and progress made in the "Open Browser" extention-search for and install "Open in Browser" extention in the VS side bar. 
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. Once changes are uploaded, navigate to the settings where your repository is displayed on GitHub and scroll down to Pages in the sidebar. Once there, under Source, select Branch:main and save. A link will then appear and although it will take time, the website will be ready.

## Status 
### Calander page should be working correctly with date displayed on the header and timeblocks with sections in diffirent colors corresponding to the time. Text entries should be saved and stored and appear on page reload.
